# Alfred-notes-workflow

This Alfred Workflow helps you use the Notes.app more easily. Here's how it works:

- **Search Notes**: Search through your notes without opening the Notes app. The results appear in a list. Once you find the note you want, you can open it directly from Alfred. 

- **Create New Notes**: Create a new note right from Alfred. Just type what you want to save, and it will automatically be added to the Notes app.
